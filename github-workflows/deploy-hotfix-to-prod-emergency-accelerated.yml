# This workflow can be triggered interactively here:
# https://github.com/getcord/monorepo/actions/workflows/deploy-hotfix-to-prod-emergency-accelerated.yml

# It is the same as deploy-hotfix-to-prod but skips a couple of nice-to-have steps
# which we don't want to spend time on if prod is literally down and we would
#Â like to shave a few minutes off bringing it back up.  Specifically, running
# npm test and waiting 30s when deregistering EC2s to settle load balancer state.
